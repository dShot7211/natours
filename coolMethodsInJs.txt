1- replace('<PASSWORD>', process.env.PASSWORD); replace a word in string
The replace() method searches a string for a value or a regular expression.

The replace() method returns a new string with the value(s) replaced.

The replace() method does not change the original string.

2- Object.assign({ id: newId }, req.body);
method is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. 
makes an obj which has id = newId and all the req body

3- multiply a string which is a number with one to convert it into number.

4-
 intourcontroller
 queryStr = queryStr.replace(/\b(gte|gt|lte|lt)\b/g, (match) => `$${match}`);


 SPLIT A STRING 
  const splittedArry = value[0].name.split(".");

5-  chat way of removing fields not in the schema as done above
     In this way we can get the values if they exist and if they not they will be stored as undefined.
     All the values that weren't destructured in any variable (the rest of the query fields) will be stored in the queryObj
     const { page, sort, limit, fields, ...queryObj } = req.query;


     find out only keys, or only values of the object 
      const value = Object.keys(err);
      const value = Object.values(err);


      getTime() gives us time in miliseconds
       this.passwordChangedAt.getTime() / 1000, // converted


     object looping in the user controller and return a new obj with filters keys 


     clone an object  
     const = oldObj; 
     let newClone = { ...oldObj}

     convert  date into string
     en-us is the language 
     toLocaleString('en-us',{month: 'long', year: 'numeric'} )



     destructure an object and give it an alias
fName, lName = are the aliases
     const {firstName: fName, lastName: lName} = user

     if the obj has an obj as well
     const user = {
      name: 'Avi',
      Address: {
      block: 'D-1',
      sector: '88',
                    }
     }

     const {Address: {block, sector}} = user;



  THE REST Operator

  const cm = ['Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy', 'Pema Khandu', 'Himanta Biswa Sarma', '	Pramod Sawant', 'Bhupendrabhai Patel']

  const [Andra,second, ...rest] 
  ...rest we are collecting the rest of the values
  rest will contain all the other cm's [ 'Himanta Biswa Sarma', '	Pramod Sawant', 'Bhupendrabhai Patel']


  THE NEW ES6 THINGS
   at() method find the element at the exact spot

   const numbers = [12, 13, 14]
   const channel = 'coding addict'
   works on string as well
numbers.at(-1) // last  -means the from the last
1 means start from the start
